# Network Traffic Analysis using Wireshark

## Objective
To understand basic network communication and analyse DNS and TCP traffic using Wireshark.

## Environment
- Operating System: Ubuntu Linux
- Network: Home Wi-Fi

## Tools Used
- Wireshark
- Linux (Ubuntu)
- Web Browser

## What I Did
- Captured live network traffic using Wireshark
- Identified DNS request and response packets
- Observed the TCP three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK)
- Analysed source and destination IP addresses

## Key Observations
- DNS queries use UDP on port 53
- TCP connection establishment follows a three-way handshake
- HTTPS traffic is encrypted, and payload data is not readable

## Security Relevance
Understanding normal network traffic patterns helps in detecting anomalies, suspicious activity, and potential security threats.

## Learning Outcome
This project strengthened my understanding of networking fundamentals, packet-level analysis, and the role of traffic monitoring in cybersecurity.
